//Create an array of movies with at least three movies.
let newArr = ['lotr1','lotr2','lotr3']
//Using the array from above, store the first movie in a variable
let movie = ( newArr[0])
//Get the length of the original array and store it in a new variable
let long = newArr.length
console.log(newArr) //The result would give us 3 because we have 3 elements in our original array.
//Get the last element in that array and store it in a new variable. What if your array was really large and you didn't know the last index? Would your solution still work?
let last = newArr[newArr.length -1]
